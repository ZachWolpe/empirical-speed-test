# Empirical Speed Test

Empirical analysis of speed of various programming languages.

## Languages

- C++
- Python

## Setup

Each implementation runs _n_ operations, and is wrapped with a CPU profiler. The results are writen to a `.prof` file that is then profiled externally.

The algorithms select are common data structures & algorithms that widely used in practice and have well understood theoretical time and space complexity, serving as great benchmarks.
